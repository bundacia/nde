an exit signal is sent from process A to process B when process A has terminated, A and B are linked. If process B is trapping exits the signal is converted into a message in the form `{:EXIT, from, reason}`
reason will be `:normal` if the process just finished execution normally.
reason will be `{exception, stacktrace}` if the process raised an exception.
reson will be `:killed` if the process was killed with `Process.exit(pid, :kill)`


:DOWN is a message that process A sens to process B when B has called Process.monitor(A) to monitor A and A has terminated

Erlang GenServer calls the terminate callback when an EXIT message is recieved. The Exit messate will not make it to handle info(?)

b GenServer.terminate

> If part of a supervision tree, a GenServerâ€™s Supervisor will send an exit signal when shutting it down.
